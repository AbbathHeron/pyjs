This directory has some experimental and conceptual exercises in improving or rewriting the pyjs compiler to be easier to test, more modular, support more python semantics and of course performance.

One major new feature being tested is using Javascript prototype as a way to implement Python MRO. As classes are loaded, instead of copying them into the subclasses, this new implementation will chain prototypes and allow true inheritance of methods, attributes, etc.
