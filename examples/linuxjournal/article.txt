Pyjamas - Desktop Widget Toolkit, AJAX Web Framework or both?

Pyjamas is several projects in one, the end result of which is that
developers can write a python GUI application that will either run as a
stand-alone Desktop application, or be compiled to pure Javascript
to run in all major modern web browsers.  It began as a port of Google
Web Toolkit; both GWT and Pyjamas can be classified as Rich Internet
Application Frameworks.  However, thanks to the Desktop version, Pyjamas
has become a competitor to Adobe AIR as well.
